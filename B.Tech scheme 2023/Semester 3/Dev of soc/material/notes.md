# Social, Political, and Economic Development

## 2.1 Unit I: Social Development (5 hours)

### Summary of Topics:

#### 1. Concepts Behind the Origin of Family, Clan, and Society
The origin of family, clan, and society is rooted in early human needs for survival, protection, and mutual support. In the primitive era, individuals relied heavily on one another for basic needs such as food, shelter, and safety from predators. Over time, this interdependence gave rise to organized social structures.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Family**: The family was the fundamental unit where responsibilities were shared. Early families worked together to gather food, rear children, and build shelters.
- **Clan**: Clans were formed by extended families, often linked by a common ancestor. They provided a larger network of support and collective resources.
- **Society**: Societies emerged as interactions between multiple clans increased. They developed shared norms, traditions, and rules to maintain harmony.

**Example for 5/10 marks question:** Early hunter-gatherer societies formed family units for resource sharing and protection. Over time, these units expanded into clans, eventually leading to organized societies with defined roles and cultural norms.
